inspiration from Dataquest

files NOT shown:
- web scraped files
- uncleaned .csv files

NOTE:\
for simplicity's sake, only first place votes for from 2022 onward were taken into account and cleaned in the data sets\
only qbs and rbs were in the final data sets as those are the only two positions who have won AP NFL MVP since 2000 (more details in data-cleaning)\

will test once 2024-2025 nfl season beings\
algorithms are lowkey scuffed b/c nfl sucks and I blow
