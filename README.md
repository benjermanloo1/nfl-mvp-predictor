NOTE:\
for simplicity's sake, mvp voting from 2022 onward (i.e. the 22-23 and 23-24 seasons) were manually reverted back to old ap nfl mvp voting standards (50 first place votes)\
MEANING data does not take into account 2nd, 3rd, ... place votes\
ex. josh allen was officially rk 5 in the ap nfl mvp voting for the 23-24 season, but is listed as rk 2 in the csv file b/c he was the only other player with a 1st place vote\
\
TODO:
- look over mvp winners and determine on which data sets should actually be used, determine how scrimmage/receiving/rushing yds will come into play
- remove non-qbs from passing data set
- remove non-rbs/qbs from rushing data set
- remove non-rbs/tes/wrs from receiving data set
- FINISH DATA CLEANING
